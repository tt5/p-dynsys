**Sturmian words** are infinite binary sequences in combinatorics on words, named after Jacques Charles François Sturm. Here are the key properties:

## Definition
Sturmian words are infinite sequences over the alphabet {0,1} with **minimal complexity** - they have exactly n+1 distinct subwords of length n for all n.

## Key Properties

**Low Complexity**: σ(n) = n + 1 for all n, where σ(n) counts distinct contiguous subwords of length n.

**Balanced and Aperiodic**: They are the only sequences that are both balanced (Hamming weight of length-n subwords takes at most two values) and aperiodic (not eventually periodic).

## Geometric Interpretations

**Cutting Sequences**: Can be generated as cutting sequences of lines with irrational slope through a grid.

**Irrational Rotations**: Represent codings of irrational rotations on the unit circle.

**Beatty Sequences**: Can be expressed as differences of non-homogeneous Beatty sequences.

## Famous Example
The **Fibonacci word** is a well-known Sturmian word with slope 1/φ (where φ is the golden ratio).

## Mathematical Structure
Each Sturmian word is characterized by:
- **Slope α** (irrational number)
- **Intercept ρ** (real number)

The standard/characteristic word c_α corresponds to intercept ρ = 0 and can be constructed using continued fractions.

Sturmian words appear in dynamical systems, symbolic dynamics, and have connections to number theory through their relationship with irrational rotations and continued fractions.
