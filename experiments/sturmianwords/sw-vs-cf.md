Excellent question! The continued fraction decomposition and the intrinsic Sturmian system are fundamentally different **types of mathematical objects** and cannot be isomorphic.

## Category Mismatch

**Continued Fraction**:
- **Object**: A sequence of integers $(a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots)$
- **Category**: Number theory / combinatorial sequences
- **Structure**: Algebraic/arithmetical

**Intrinsic Sturmian System**:
- **Object**: A dynamical system $(X, T)$ where $X$ is a symbolic space
- **Category**: Topological dynamics / ergodic theory  
- **Structure**: Geometric/dynamical

## Why They Can't Be Isomorphic

**1. Different Mathematical "Species"**:
- Numbers vs. dynamical systems
- Static sequences vs. evolving systems
- Algebraic vs. geometric structures

**2. Different Operations Preserved**:
- Continued fractions: arithmetic operations, convergence
- Sturmian systems: shift dynamics, symbolic coding

**3. Different Invariants**:
- CF: Partial quotients, convergents, approximation quality
- Sturmian: Factor complexity, entropy, ergodic measures

## What Actually Happens

The continued fraction **encodes information about** the intrinsic system, but they're not the same object:

$$\alpha = [0; a_1, a_2, \ldots] \quad \longrightarrow \quad \text{Sturmian system of slope } \alpha$$

This is a **map between categories**, not an isomorphism within a category.

## Analogy

Think of:
- **Continued fraction**: The DNA sequence of an organism
- **Sturmian system**: The actual living organism

The DNA determines the organism, but a sequence of letters is not isomorphic to a living being - they exist in completely different categories of reality.

## Mathematical Relationship

The continued fraction is a **complete invariant** that determines the isomorphism class of the Sturmian system, but it's not isomorphic to the system itself.

So the answer is: they can't be isomorphic because they're not even objects in the same mathematical category!
