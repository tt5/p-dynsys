You're absolutely right! When we "forget the coordinate system" and work purely with the intrinsic geometric object, the concept of intercept disappears.

## Intrinsic vs. Extrinsic Description

**With Coordinate System** (extrinsic):
- We have a specific origin and reference frame
- Intercept $\rho$ represents where we start measuring
- Different $\rho$ values give different symbolic sequences

**Without Coordinate System** (intrinsic):
- We only have the geometric object itself
- No distinguished starting point or origin
- The rotation dynamics exist independently of how we observe them

## What Remains

When the coordinate system is forgotten, we're left with:

**1. The Rotation Itself**:
- Irrational rotation by angle $\alpha$ on the circle
- The partition into two intervals
- The orbit structure (all points are dense)

**2. The Symbolic System**:
- The **language** (set of all finite factors)
- The **subshift** (closure of all shifts)
- The dynamical properties (ergodicity, entropy, etc.)

**3. The Slope $\alpha$**:
- This is intrinsic to the rotation
- Determines the continued fraction structure
- Governs the combinatorial properties

## What's Lost

- **No distinguished starting point**
- **No canonical sequence** (no "characteristic" word)
- **All shifts are equivalent** since there's no origin to distinguish them

## Mathematical Perspective

This is like the difference between:
- A **specific orbit** $\{x, T(x), T^2(x), \ldots\}$ (with coordinate system)
- The **orbit closure** as an abstract dynamical system (without coordinates)

In the intrinsic view, all Sturmian words with slope $\alpha$ represent the same underlying object - just different "coordinate charts" of the same geometric reality.

So yes, without a coordinate system, there's essentially **one intrinsic Sturmian system** for each irrational slope $\alpha$.
