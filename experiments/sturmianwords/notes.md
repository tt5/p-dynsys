Sturmian words represent the most elementary form of chaotic dynamics - they are aperiodic yet maximally structured, making them perfect models for studying the transition from order to chaos in dynamical systems.

Key Dynamical Properties
Minimal Complexity: Among non-periodic sequences, Sturmian sequences have minimal complexity σ(n) = n + 1, making them the "simplest" aperiodic dynamical systems.

Unique Ergodicity: Sturmian systems are uniquely ergodic, meaning they have exactly one invariant probability measure, which is supported on the entire space.

Zero Entropy: They have zero topological entropy, reflecting their highly ordered nature despite being aperiodic.
